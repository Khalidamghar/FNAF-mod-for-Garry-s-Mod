The series of survival horror games have become known for their unique animatronic characters and jump scare moments, and have inspired a number of fan-made games and mods. One such mod is the FNAF mod for Garry's Mod, which allows players to bring the animatronic characters from the FNAF universe into the sandbox game."

The game was initially released as a mod for Valve Corporation's Half-Life 2 in 2004, but has since become a standalone game. Garry's Mod allows players to manipulate objects and create their own game modes using the game's built-in Lua scripting language. The game has a large community of players who create and share custom content, including maps, models, and game modes."

      "description": "One of the most popular game modes in the FNAF mod is the "Night Shift" mode. This mode is similar to the gameplay of the FNAF series, where players must survive a night shift at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza while avoiding the animatronic characters. In the Garry's Mod version of the game, players can take on the role of either a security guard or one of the animatronic characters. The security guard must survive the night by monitoring the security cameras and keeping the animatronics out of the office, while the animatronics must find and kill the security guard."
